👤 AppClientes
A Java-based terminal application to register and view client names — simple, intuitive, and built for learning.

📘 Developed as a class project to reinforce Java fundamentals like loops, conditionals, user input, and ArrayLists.

📦 Features
✅ Register clients by name

📋 List all clients in the terminal

❌ Exit safely when you're done

💡 Fully interactive menu system

🧠 How It Works
When you run the app, it displays:


--- CLIENT REGISTRATION SYSTEM ---
Menu:
1. Register Client
2. View Clients
3. Exit
   
🔹 Option 1: User inputs a name → it’s stored in memory
🔹 Option 2: Lists all registered clients (if any)
🔹 Option 3: Gracefully exits the program

📌 Clients are stored in a dynamic ArrayList<String> — no database or file storage involved.
